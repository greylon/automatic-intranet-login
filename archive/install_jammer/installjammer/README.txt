version of UNIX with eventual support for Mac OS X.


~ Features:

* Installs are packaged in single binary executables for each platform
  making web distribution easy.
* Support for multiple install themes.
* Default install themes that resemble popular, commercial installers.
* A high level of configurability.
* Built-in support for Windows install conventions.
* Automatic creation of an uninstaller.
* Easily extended to new platforms.


~ Installing:

If you downloaded the source from the website as a release or as a snapshot,
you're already done.  InstallJammer only needs to be unpacked, and it's
ready to go.  If you have binaries available for your platform, you can
type: ./installjammer to get going.

If you checked out a copy of the source from the source repository, you have
all of the code to run InstallJammer, but you don't have the binaries for
your platform to be able to actually run anything.  You'll need to download
at least the binaries for the platform you are running on to get going.
