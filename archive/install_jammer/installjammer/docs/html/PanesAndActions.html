<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>The Install / Uninstall Panes and Actions section of the install builder shows a tree of your install's user interface.&nbsp; The user interface is first defined by a set of possible install types.&nbsp; Underneath that is a list of all of the panes that are included in that install type.&nbsp; Each pane can have any number of actions that execute as the user moves through the install.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts5>Panes</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Selecting a pane in the tree will bring up some information for that pane as well as properties that you can modify to customize the pane.&nbsp; See </span><a class=rvts8 href="WhatArePanes.html">What are Panes?</a><span class=rvts3> for more details.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts4>Actions</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3>Selecting an action in the tree will bring up some information for that action as well as properties that you can modify to customize the action.&nbsp; See </span><a class=rvts9 href="WhatAreActions.html">What are Actions?</a><span class=rvts3> for more details.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>The user interface tree defines how the user will see your install when they run it.&nbsp; It contains several install modes that are defined by InstallJammer, and beneath those are the panes that are included for that install mode.&nbsp; Each pane can have any number of actions attached to it.</span></p>

<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts5>Common Components&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>This section of the interface tree is used to hold panes of an install theme that don't belong anywhere in the install process itself.&nbsp; Panes installed in the Common Components section can be modified just like normal panes, but you don't have the option to add the same pane to an install type.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Common examples of this are a background window that covers the screen behind the install wizard with some text or images.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts5>Standard Install</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>This section contains the panes used by InstallJammer for a standard installation.&nbsp; A standard installation is when the user chooses to install the application just as you built it.&nbsp; All of the panes will be shown in order as they are shown on the interface tree.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts5>Default Install</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>A default install is when the user has chosen to accept all of your default settings and just do the install without changing anything.&nbsp; The default install usually contains just a few screens to prompt the user to confirm installation and then to copy all of the files.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts5>Console Install</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>A console install is when the user wants to install the program from a command line instead of through the GUI interface.&nbsp; A console install will run inside a terminal window and everything will be input and output to and from the terminal.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<div class=rvps1><table border=0 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=2 style="border-width: 0px;">

<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts5>Silent Install</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>A silent install is when the user wants to accept all of the default options and install the program silently without a GUI interface.&nbsp; This is useful for some administrators who have to install an application on many different machines.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>A silent install does not have any panes, only actions.&nbsp; Because of this, you will only see a list of actions under the Silent Install, and you are not allowed to add panes.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts5>Action Groups</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Action groups are a way to group actions together into one place.&nbsp; An action group can contain any number of actions to execute and has its own conditions and properties as well as those of the actions it holds.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Action groups are best used if you define an alias for them so that you don't always have to remember the ID of the action group.&nbsp; This is how InstallJammer sets up the default Startup Actions and Install Actions groups when it creates a new project.&nbsp; You can execute all of the actions in an action group by using the </span><span class=rvts3>Execute Actions action.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3>See </span><a class=rvts11 href="WhatAreActionGroups.html">What are Action Groups?</a></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts4><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts4><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts4>Previewing a pane</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3>Once you've selected a pane you will see a button in the bottom right-hand corner of the properties window to preview the pane.&nbsp; Clicking this button will pop up a sample wizard with the pane you're currently viewing.&nbsp; This lets you see the pane the way it will appear during installation.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3>Most options, if changed, will automatically affect the appearance of the preview window, so you should be able to make textual and design changes, click Preview Pane again, and immediately see your changes.&nbsp; Not all changes are immediately seen.&nbsp; Some changes and options can only be seen when actually running the install.&nbsp; In this case, simply build and run a test install of your project to see what the panes will look like.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts4>Editing pane code</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3>Each pane in an install is defined by the Tcl/Tk code that built it.&nbsp; InstallJammer gives you the freedom and flexibility to modify each pane in your install to be exactly what you want it to be.&nbsp; Simply click the Edit Pane Code button when editing a pane, and an editor will pop up with all of the Tcl/Tk code used to create the pane you're looking at.&nbsp; If you don't understand Tcl/Tk code, you might want to read </span><a class=rvts10 href="WhatIsTclTk.html">What is Tcl/Tk?</a><span class=rvts3> as a starting point.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts4>Restoring original pane code</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3>The Restore Original Pane button will restore the original code for the pane currently being edited.&nbsp; This is useful if you wish to remove the changes you've made to the pane or you accidentally messed up the pane code.&nbsp; Restoring the pane code will put the pane code back into its original state.&nbsp; It will not modify your properties though.&nbsp; Only the code of the pane.</span><span class=rvts1></span></p>
