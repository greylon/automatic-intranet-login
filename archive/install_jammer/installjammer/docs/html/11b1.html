<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3>1.1b1 (January 17th, 2007)</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>This is a very big release, so not all of the changes are noted here.&nbsp; This is a list of everything I could remember.</span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3>Major Enhancements</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Changed the underlying file format for installers to a homegrown format that allows for more customization.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Installkits have all been updated.&nbsp; GUI components are now dynamically loaded so that Console and Silent installs can be run on machines with no X libraries.&nbsp; This also resulted in the installkits being much smaller for most platforms.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added new platforms: AIX, FreeBSD, HP-UX, and Solaris sparc. [</span><span class=rvts3>Req #1459564, #1487035</span><span class=rvts2>]</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added support for building TAR files (with or without GZIP) from a project.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added LZMA compression support. [</span><span class=rvts3>Req #1487034</span><span class=rvts2>]</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added support for "solid" archives.&nbsp; A solid archive is built as one big file before being compressed.&nbsp; This can often result in installers that are much smaller.&nbsp; Solid archives must first be extracted to a temporary location before they can be installed though.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added support for defining custom command-line options for (un)installers.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added support for specifying a custom build and install location for every file group, directory or file in a project.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added support for relative file locations in the install builder. [</span><span class=rvts3>Req #1525104</span><span class=rvts2>]</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added support for customizing the compression for every file group, directory or file in a project.&nbsp; This means some file groups, directories or even single files can all be compressed with different compression methods.&nbsp; The choice is yours.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a Console install mode for installing via a console on non-Windows platforms. [</span><span class=rvts3>Req #1546821</span><span class=rvts2>]</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new Test Uninstall section for specifying options when testing an uninstaller.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added support for creating shortcuts under Linux (and FreeBSD) program menus. [</span><span class=rvts3>Req #1487037</span><span class=rvts2>]</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added support for prompting the user for root when the installer requires it. [</span><span class=rvts3>Req #1487036</span><span class=rvts2>]</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Deleted files are no longer removed from a project.&nbsp; They are disabled (greyed out) in the file group tree and can be deleted or continue to be part of the project. [</span><span class=rvts3>Req #1525114</span><span class=rvts2>]</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added new Upgrade Application ID property for projects that denotes that a project is an upgrade install of another application.&nbsp; Some actions for new projects have been changed to not be executed on an upgrade install.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added support for registering an application with </span><span class=rvts3>RPM</span><span class=rvts2> or </span><span class=rvts3>DPKG</span><span class=rvts2> databases through the </span><a class=rvts4 href="RegisterPackage.html">Register Package</a><span class=rvts2> action.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>The InstallJammer documentation now includes a PDF version of the user guide.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3>Major Bug Fixes</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug that was causing non-Latin characters to display incorrectly on Linux (and other UNIX) platforms. [</span><span class=rvts3>Bug #1522660</span><span class=rvts2>]</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where installers could not be built if the name of the installer or path contained non-Latin characters. [</span><span class=rvts3>Bug #1517067</span><span class=rvts2>]</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Symbolic links that are included in a file group are now handled as links by the installer.&nbsp; The same link will be created pointing to the same file on the target system during installation. [</span><span class=rvts3>Bug #1499834</span><span class=rvts2>]</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where multiple installations of an application on the same machine would be removed when only one of the uninstallers was executed. [</span><span class=rvts3>Bug #1533190</span><span class=rvts2>]</span></li>

<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3>Minor Enhancements</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added new Copyright poperty for projects.&nbsp; This is added to the Windows resource information of a Windows executable when built.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added new preference to save only toplevel directories and files when saving a project.&nbsp; This is mostly for developers who are using an InstallJammer project as a template that is then built from a command-line.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added Default Install Mode property.&nbsp; The current default is a Standard GUI install.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a section for Package Information that is used when adding packages to the local packaging system on Linux.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a common Data property to all objects that can be used to store user-specific data on an object which can then be used by other actions and conditions.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a Target Filename property for files that will allow installed files to be renamed on the target system.&nbsp; This allows for a total re-mapping of files in an installer during installation.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>The Comment and Data properties of objects are not stored in an install if they are blank.&nbsp; This just saves a little space when building.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added new Show Setup Type property to Setup Types to specify that the given Setup Type should not be offered as a choice during installation.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Actions and Panes with conditions are now shown with * beside their title as a quick way to see that they are affected by some action.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>New objects added since the last time the project was opened are added in blue.&nbsp; This is a quick way to see what is new to the project.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new default Setup Actions action group that will execute before command-line options are parsed.&nbsp; This can (and should only) be used for setting virtual text and manipulating platform-specific command-line options before the installer really gets going.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a new test option for testing in Console mode on non-UNIX platforms.&nbsp; This will open a console window and start the install inside it.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added new preferences for specifying custom locations for Themes, Actions and Conditions.&nbsp; This will allow developers to create their own custom components in locations outside of the InstallJammer directories.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added a button to stop install builds that are in progress.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added new properties to the Add Widget action that allow any non-label widget to have a label included as part of the widget itself.&nbsp; This makes it easier to add new widgets without always having to add a second widget for a label.</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Added new "browse entry" widget to the Add Widget action.&nbsp; This is an entry with a browse button for selecting a file or directory on the target system.</span></li>

<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts2><br></span></p>
<p class=rvps1><span class=rvts3>Minor Bug Fixes</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside;">
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where using a Choose Components pane on a non-Custom setup type would result in a blank component list. [</span><span class=rvts3>Bug #1614930</span><span class=rvts2>]</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where files were being included in a platform where the file group had not been included. [</span><span class=rvts3>Bug #1615241</span><span class=rvts2>]</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where the Choose Components pane would error when populating the component list if a child component was added where the parent was not. [</span><span class=rvts3>Bug #1611703</span><span class=rvts2>]</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where the License Agreement pane would not disable the Yes button on first display, which would allow the user to skip the license without checking the Yes button. [</span><span class=rvts3>Bug #1593788</span><span class=rvts2>]</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a typo in the Create File Link action. [</span><span class=rvts3>Bug #1588953</span><span class=rvts2>]</span></li>

<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where a Condition that was deactivated during installation would still be checked. [</span><span class=rvts3>Bug #1585469</span><span class=rvts2>]</span></li>
<li class=rvps1><span class=rvts2>Fixed a bug where an entry widget added through the Add Widget action would lose its virtual text when the pane was displayed. [</span><span class=rvts3>Bug #1585399</span><span class=rvts2>]</span><span class=rvts1></span></li>
