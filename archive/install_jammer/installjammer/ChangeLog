2010-08-24  Damon Courtney <damon@installjammer.com>  [072d9c0]
    Update ReadInstalInfo API to add bits of ReadPreviousInstall.
    
    Modifed the ReadInstallInfo API to be more like the Check for Previous
    Install action.  The API now has a -prefix option and always sets the
    common properties.  See the docs for the new behavior if you're using this
    API.
    
    The Check for Previous Install action no longer caches its information
    with the first run.  This means that subsequent calls to this action will
    rebuild the virtual text variables, but it will not delete variables set
    by previous invocations.
    
    Rewrote the ReadPreviousInstall call to use the new API.  Maintaining the
    PreviousInstallInfo array for people who were previously using this
    internal call.
    
    Rewrote the Get Previous Install Info action to use the API better.

    wasn't before.

    Make sure the install information is updated before we redraw the setup
