Q: Why are you putting variable names in prototypes in /* comment */ blocks?
A: This is recommended by CERT's secure coding guideline API08-C.
   "Naming the parameters in a prototype declaration should never be necessary, and is often unwise,
   because these names can be affected by macro definitions. Although the scope of an identifier in
   a function prototype begins at its declaration and ends at the end of that function's declarator,
   this scope is ignored by the preprocessor. Consequently, an identifier in a prototype having the
   same name as that of an existing macro is treated as an invocation of that macro.

   Safeguarding parameter names is particularly critical in standard and system headers where the
   user expects to be able to include the header and have only the function names visible."
